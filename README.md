# 🧠 Classifying Buenos Aires Neighborhoods by Living Conditions

This Data Science project explores socioeconomic conditions across neighborhoods in Buenos Aires using open geospatial and administrative datasets. Our goal is to classify areas by quality of life, infrastructure, and social indicators, and to visualize them interactively.
We cluster using PCA and KMeans, and create interactive maps.

## 📦 Dataset Sources

- Crime and demographics — BA Open Data
- Noise, green areas, metro, hospitals — Gobierno de la Ciudad
- Shapefiles — GeoBA

## 🛠 Methods

- Feature Engineering (e.g., slum density, green space %, crime rate per 1000)
- PCA for dimensionality reduction
- KMeans clustering
- Interactive map with Folium

## 🎯 Results

We identified 6 clusters:
- Highly comfortable
- Balanced safe zones
- Marginalized and high crime zones
